# 🖧 Raspberry Pi Cluster – High Performance on a Budget

A distributed cluster using Raspberry Pi 4 and MPI to explore parallel computing, load balancing, and other MPI features.

---

## 📝 Description

This project builds a **fully functional cluster using Raspberry Pi 4**, where:

- Each Pi acts as a compute node.
- **MPI (Message Passing Interface)** is used for parallel task execution.
- C/C++ programs can be distributed and executed across nodes.
- The system can easily scale with additional nodes.
- File distribution and remote execution are automated.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++ with MPI  
- **Hardware:** 4× Raspberry Pi 4  
- **Operating System:** Raspberry Pi OS Lite (headless)  
- **Network:** Ethernet + switch  
- **Automation:** SSH, `rsync`, `tmux`, `bash scripts`
